HTML ELEMENT EXPLANATION:

1. <h1> to <h6>:
   These are heading tags used to define headings of different levels. 
   <h1> is the most important (main title), and <h6> is the least. 
   I used all six to show hierarchy and structure clearly.

2. <nav> and <ul>/<li>:
   <nav> defines a block of navigation links. 
   Inside it, <ul> (unordered list) and <li> (list items) create a menu of links to other pages.

3. <a href="...">:
   The anchor tag creates hyperlinks. Itâ€™s used for internal navigation (between pages) and external resources .

4. <ul> and <ol>:
   <ul> is used to list my skills without any particular order.
   <ol> is used to list my educational background in a ordered manner.

5. <img src="" alt="">:
   This element displays an image. The alt attribute provides alternative text if the image fails to load or for screen readers.

6. <table>:
   Used to display my projects/work experience in a structured tabular format with rows and columns.

7. <p>:
   Paragraph tag used for writing about myself.

8. <form>:
   The main wrapper for all form fields used in the contact page.

9. <input> (text, email, tel, checkbox, radio, submit):
   - type="text" for entering the name
   - type="email" ensures valid email format
   - type="tel" allows phone number input
   - type="checkbox" allows multiple preferred contact methods to be selected
   - type="radio" is used to choose one inquiry type (only one can be selected)
   - type="submit" creates a button to send the form

10. <textarea>:
    Allows multi-line text input for the message field.

11. <fieldset> and <legend>:
    Group related inputs (like checkboxes and radio buttons) together to improve accessibility and structure.

REASONS FOR SPECIFIC INPUT TYPES:

- I used "text" for name as it accepts general text.
- "email" input provides built-in validation for correct email formatting.
- "tel" is ideal for phone numbers and optimizes mobile keyboard layout.
- "checkbox" allows selecting more than one contact method.
- "radio" ensures only one inquiry type is chosen.
- "submit" is necessary to send the form data.

NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:

The <nav> element contains a <ul> (unordered list) of <li> elements, each with an <a> tag.
This structure links to:
- portfolio.html (Home)
- about.html (About)
- contact.html (Contact)

This allows users to easily move between the main pages of the site, improving usability.
